      <b>Description:</b> <br> <br>
      Breaking Bad is an American crime drama television series created and
      produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC. Set and filmed in Albuquerque, New
      Mexico, the series follows Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underpaid,
      dispirited high-school chemistry teacher struggling with a recent
      diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to a life of crime and
      partners with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), to produce and
      distribute methamphetamine to secure his family's financial future before
      he dies, while navigating the dangers of the criminal underworld. Breaking
      Bad premiered on AMC on January 20, 2008, and concluded on September 29,
      2013, after five seasons consisting of 62 episodes.

          Walter adopts the pseudonym "Heisenberg" and trades his "blue sky"
          meth with psychotic drug lord Tuco Salamanca. The DEA and Hank, Walt's
