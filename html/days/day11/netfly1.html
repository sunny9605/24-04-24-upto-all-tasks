          strike only seven episodes were filmed.[30] It ran from January 20 to

          conspires with Jesse to cook crystal meth to pay for his treatment and

          cook in, while Walter devises a revolutionary formula using
          unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue.
          After a run-in with the Mexican cartel, Walter adopts the pseudonym
          "Heisenberg" and trades his "blue sky" meth with psychotic drug lord
          Tuco Salamanca. The DEA and Hank, Walt's brother-in-law, become aware
          of Heisenberg's presence in the drug trade and begin investigating.

          <b>Description:</b> <br />The first season was originally intended to
          be nine episodes, but due to the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America
          strike only seven episodes were filmed.[30] It ran from January 20 to
          March 9, 2008. Walter, diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer,
          conspires with Jesse to cook crystal meth to pay for his treatment and
          provide financial security for his family. Jesse secures an R.V. to
          cook in, while Walter devises a revolutionary formula using
          unregulated chemicals, creating a highly pure product tinted blue.
          After a run-in with the Mexican cartel, Walter adopts the pseudonym
          "Heisenberg" and trades his "blue sky" meth with psychotic drug lord
          Tuco Salamanca. The DEA and Hank, Walt's brother-in-law, become aware
          of Heisenberg's presence in the drug trade and begin investigating.
